# Introduction

Relay ratings from Plex to ListenBrainz or Last.fm based on a defined Plex rating threshold.

For example, setting `RATING_THRESHOLD=6.0` will consider any tracks with 3 star ratings or higher to be Loved Tracks. `RATING_THRESHOLD=10.0` would consider only tracks with 5 star ratings.

As of v0.2.0, Last.fm and ListenBrainz are supported. Other services such as Libre.fm will be added in future versions. If there is a service you would like to be added, please submit a new issue with the details.
